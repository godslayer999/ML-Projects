Extract the 3 zipped files into respective folders i.e. into 'A', 'B' and 'C' folder before running the notebook.
The sign_language.py file in the datasets folder is there for importing the dataset into pandas Dataframe format.
The same file also splits the dataset into training and testing set.
This file is loaded as a module in the main file and used to get the dataset imported.

To change the Training-Testing split ratio open the sign_language.py, and modify the split ration argument.
